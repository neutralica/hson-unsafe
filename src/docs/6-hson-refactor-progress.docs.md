progress update 6: developments and invariants in the Big Refactor

these changes clarify and override any contradictions in previous updates: 

Single canonical shape for comparison: always compare NEW nodes (never mix OLD/NEW in the comparator) now that all formats are refactored to creatre them.
strings in _content → _str node with the raw string as its _content[0] //(this was already in effect)
- other primitives (BasicValues) → _val (aka _prim) with the BasicValue in _content[0] // (same)
- Array wrapper policy: we *HAVE BEEN* wrapping _arr nodes (the structural representation of JSON arrays) in _obj; going forward _arr will also be a cluster VSN and does not need to be wrapped again in _obj. This is in-progress and may not be completely implemented. the canonical NEW should never serialize an array as `key: {[ ... ]}`.

- Meta rule: only keys that start with data-_ belong in _meta (stringified). We were special-casing data-_index or data-_quid, the two current _meta properties we know we use. those are now being stored exactly as they're found in the attribute wire: data-_index or data-_quid. Everything else data-* (no underscore) stays in _attrs -- it's a user data-attribute. system data-attributes only have data-_*(_META_DATA_PREFIX = 'data-_') prefixes-- `data-_*` is reserved for HSON metadata.


Compat layer changes 

toOLD (NEW → OLD)
converts html boolean "flags" (found as attrs[k] === k) into _meta.flags, then removes them from _attrs.
Serializes style object → CSS string to match legacy output.
Moves all _meta entries whose keys start with data-_ (_META_DATA_PREFIX) into _meta.attrs['data-_*'], coerced to strings; leaves other meta keys at _meta top level (there are currently no other _meta keys that I can think of that don't begin with `data-_`).

FlattenSoleArray logic: if _content is a single _obj|_elem whose only child is _arr, return the _arr directly under the tag in OLD (prevents legacy {[ ... ]} diffs).

toNEW (OLD → NEW)
Pulls legacy attrs from _meta.attrs and legacy flags from _meta.flags, **merging flags into _attrs** (flags → attrs[flag] = flag).
_meta on NEW drops attrs/flags; keeps any 'data-_' in _meta
Recurses into children; all primitives should be wrapped in _str or _val in nodes

Normalization & comparator

normalizeNEWStrict
Accepts a HsonNode_NEW (or array in the overload; all call sites now pass nodes).
Normalizes style (string/object) to a canonical object via normalize_style(); drops it if empty.
Coerces all data-_… attr values to strings, moves to _meta. all 'data-_' properties go to _meta
Promotes primitives in _content: strings → _str; other primitives → _val. // (***this should not be done by the normalizer/comparator; it should already be the idiomatic shape of the nodes, both old and new. FYI.***)
Collapses _content: [ _obj( [ _arr ] ) ] → _content: [ _arr ]. (// this is a new rule and may not be fully implemented yet; _arr is newly its own 'cluster' vsn as of this update, and doesn't need an extra _obj wrapper)
Omits the single empty _obj|_elem under _root. // this is new and hasn't/doesn't quite feel right to me; _root used to always have an _elem or _obj wrapper and I'm not super fussed either way but it maybe still should for consistency
Sorts _attrs / _meta for stable stringify.

normalizeOld(node) helper
Converts any lingering OLD nodes to NEW via toNEW, then recurses through normalizeNEWStrict.
Tolerates OLD or NEW input, converts to NEW (via toNEW if needed), then runs normalizeNEWStrict.
// comparator still needs work and may have sprawled slightly more than we want

HSON tokenizer / parser fixes
Quoted text handling: ensured that quoted text tokens are parsed as string values (without the quotes themselves stored within the node’s _content) so that "1" becomes _str("1") and not a literal including escape characters.
lex_text_piece returns { text, quoted } (we don’t rely on endIx here; scanning/segmenting is handled elsewhere).
Parser side respects quoted _content and promotes to _str. unquoted (true/false, number, null) _content is promoted to _val

Close tokens (Step E):
Unified around TOKEN_KIND const: 'OPEN', 'CLOSE', 'ARR_OPEN', 'ARR_CLOSE', 'TEXT'. (TOKEN_KIND.OPEN etc)
Guarded the closer logic so it only triggers when the closer regex matches, validates stack top, and respects implicit clusters (no extra CLOSE for implicit opens).

HTML side & 3-way tests
HTML parse/serialize cycle matched after:
Proper string unescape/escape (don’t double-quote text nodes).
Ensuring _elem wrappers are present for clusters and that the normalizer collapses undesired _obj/_elem → _arr patterns.

The lingering JSON 3-way mismatches were mostly comparator illusions (OLD vs NEW shape mixing) and primitive promotion gaps. After switching to canonical NEW-only comparison and promoting primitives in the normalizer, the diffs reduced to real transform issues when they appear.
Attribute & meta utilities

Introduced/standardized _META_DATA_PREFIX = 'data-_' and use it everywhere:
split_attrs_meta: routes all data-_… from the wire into _meta.
normalize_meta in tests uses the same prefix rule to compare only meta keys that start with data-_.
Flags conversion helpers retained (flags ↔︎ attrs) and applied consistently in toOLD/toNEW.
“Always wrap _contents” (in an _elem or _obj VSN wrapper) policy confirmed (but _arr counts as a wrapper, or will in the future)
Keep wrapping content in _obj (JSON) / _elem (HTML) early (even single child), because it prevents shape churn when siblings are added later. (HSON can wrap in either, determined by the closer: > for _obj, /> for _elem--these will rarely or never be mixed in the same HSON)
Rely on the normalizer to collapse the exact single _obj → _arr case so the wire form for a: [1,2,3] stays a: [1,2,3] (not {[ … ]}).

new snippets that seem to be mostly OK
normalizeNode & normalizeNEWStrict final version 
 - helper for all comparisons.
compat: toOLD with data-_ re-routing into _meta.attrs and FlattenSoleArray logic.
compat: toNEW with flags→attrs folding, and attrs/flags stripping from _meta and only living in _attrs, **except for any data-_ keys which will still live in _meta**.
HSON tokenizer Step E closer handling, emitting CLOSE consistently.

What to verify next (quick checklist)
Re-run JSON and HTML 3-ways after ensuring all comparison sites use normalizeNode (some older test helpers may diff old and new Node types against each other, which will lead to false negatives).
Confirm tokenizer’s quoted-text path is hit for all cases that render as "1" in HSON; the node should hold _str("1"), not a string with literal quotes.
Double-check any remaining places that manually look for data-_index/data-_quid (with or without underscore); replace with the generic k.startsWith(_META_DATA_PREFIX).
