liveTree = “operate on HTML via a stable JSON model (NEW)”.
liveMap = “render JSON into a human-readable, editable HTML view, and optionally keep it live and bidirectional.”
Here’s the shape of the problem and where the difficulty sits, relative to liveTree.
Concept split
Snapshot (read-only): one-way render of a JSON value to HTML. No interactivity; rerender on demand.
Dashboard (live readout): one-way render that auto-updates when JSON changes (subscribe to model events and patch the DOM).
Control Panel (editable): two-way binding: DOM edits flow back to JSON; JSON updates flow to DOM.
Core pieces you’ll need
View schema (even if implicit):
Mapping from JSON → widgets and labels. Without hints, you’ll guess:
object → key/value rows;
array → list/table;
primitives → text/span (display) or input[type=…] (edit).
A light schema lets you pick correct controls (number vs slider vs checkbox), ranges/steps, labels, order, hidden fields, grouping, etc. You can default heuristically and allow overrides per key path.
Renderer:
Deterministic HTML from a JSON subtree + schema node. Reuse your NEW node machinery: generate NEW for the view (e.g., <div class=row><span class=label>key</span><span class=value>…</span></div>), then pipe through your existing NEW→DOM path. Keys become text labels or data-label—not tags.
Identity + patching:
Reuse QUIDs to give each rendered field a stable identity. When data changes, compute a minimal patch: update text, input value, rows added/removed/reordered. Do not fully rerender on each tick.
Binding layer (two-way only):
Outbound: subscribe to model mutations; apply DOM patches.
Inbound: delegate input/change events; map [data-_quid] (or path) → model path; validate; write back. Guard with the same reentrancy counter you planned for DOM sync.
Validation + coercion:
Numbers, booleans, enums, dates. Schema drives this; fallback heuristics otherwise. Show invalid state but don’t corrupt the model.
Layout + paging for scale:
Large arrays/objects need collapse/expand, lazy render, and virtual lists to avoid DOM blow-ups.
A11y + keyboard:
Labels (<label for=…> or ARIA), focus rings, tab order. Easy to skip; painful later.
Difficulty vs liveTree
Snapshot: easier than liveTree. It’s just a serializer with a presentational template.
Dashboard (one-way live): roughly comparable to the non-sync parts of liveTree. You already have identity and maps; the main work is patching and avoiding full rerenders.
Control Panel (two-way): this is where difficulty climbs. It overlaps with the DOM→model sync you just scoped: event capture, validation, reentrancy, array reindexing, conflict policy. Still simpler than “arbitrary external edits” because you own the widgets and their semantics.
Clean architecture (keeps it tractable)
Model events: fire onChange(path, op, payload) from your NEW mutators.
Schema mini-DSL: { type, widget, min, max, step, enum, label, description, readonly, hidden } at paths. Optional, merge with heuristics.
Path addressing: stable JSONPointer/dot-path per field; store it in _meta of the view NEW node and mirror to DOM via data-path (or just rely on QUID).
Renderer contract: render(path, value, schemaNode) -> NEW subtree.
Patcher: diff old vs new at the view NEW level (cheap; structure known) and apply minimal DOM ops via existing maps.
Binding: event → path → coerce/validate → set in model → renderer patch executes.
Controls registry: map {type, hints} → input component. Defaults:
boolean → checkbox
number → number/slider (use min/max/step if present)
string (short) → text; (long) → textarea; (matches URL/email) → specialized
enum → select/radios
array<object> small → table; else list with row components
object → section with labeled rows
Where the gotchas live
Arrays: insert/delete/reorder must maintain _ii/data-_index invariants. You’ve already hardened this—reuse the same helpers.
Coercion drift: DOM gives you strings; model wants numbers/booleans/dates. Keep coerce() symmetric with your serializers.
Performance: naïve rerender on every keystroke will jank; patch the single field or debounce.
Schema absence: heuristics can pick wrong widgets; permit runtime overrides per path.
Staleness: if someone mutates the JSON through other APIs, dashboard must update; you need a single source of truth and change notifications.
Suggested milestones
Snapshot view for primitives/objects/arrays; labels visible.
Dashboard: subscribe to model events; patch text/attrs; expand/collapse; basic paging.
Control inputs for primitives with validation; two-way for booleans/numbers/strings/enums.
Arrays of objects editing (add/remove/reorder rows).
Schema overrides (per-path widgets, constraints).
Perf polish (virtual lists, batched patches).
A11y polish.
API sketch (conceptual)
liveMap.render(rootValue, schema?) -> LiveTree_NEW (returns a LiveTree handle to the view)
liveMap.attach(model, rootEl, schema?) (dashboard; subscribes to model)
liveMap.control(model, rootEl, schema?) (control panel; two-way binding)
Bottom line: liveMap is straightforward as a snapshot, manageable as a dashboard, and moderately complex as a full control panel. It should be simpler than liveTree’s DOM sync because you control the generated markup and the widgets. Your existing QUID, maps, coercion, and array/index machinery give you most of the skeleton already.

*** +: setAttrs() (multiple attribute setter - pass an object and all attrs are applied)

 
    This absolutely can be a web component. It’s a natural fit:
Snapshot mode: render a JSON subtree to HTML (labels + values). No interactivity.
Dashboard mode: subscribe to store; apply patches to the rendered view (text changes, row inserts, etc.).
Control-panel mode: your view emits input events → patches back to the store (two-way), guarded against loops.
Architecture that keeps it sane:
A liveMap host element owns a store handle and a renderer.
The renderer builds predictable NEW/HSON for the view (object → rows, arrays → lists/tables, primitives → spans/inputs).
Each field gets a stable identity (your QUID/path).
Store change → compute minimal view patch → update DOM.
User edit → validate/coerce → emit store patch.
Origin token on writes avoids ping-pong.
You can mount that liveMap view inside an <hson-window> (good synergy) or separately. The window remains a thin “chrome” element; liveMap is the data view.

Lifecycle facts for WindowComponent
Parsed in HTML before define: the tag sits as an unknown element. When you later call customElements.define('window-component', WindowComponent), the browser upgrades it:
runs the class constructor once,
then, if it’s already in the document, calls connectedCallback().
Created in code then appended: document.createElement('window-component') runs the constructor immediately; connectedCallback() fires when you append into a document (or into any subtree already in the document).
Move/remove: removing triggers disconnectedCallback(); re-inserting triggers connectedCallback() again. Moving between documents also triggers adoptedCallback() then connectedCallback().
Attribute changes: after upgrade/connection, attribute sets go through attributeChangedCallback() (for names in observedAttributes), whether you set them before or after connection.
Upgrade order gotcha: if you read DOM children in constructor, you’ll see nothing yet; do DOM work in connectedCallback().
That’s the mental model: constructor = make the shell; connected = wire it up.
liveTree ↔ liveMap: make the bridge the foundation, not an adapter
You’re seeing the right symmetry. Treat them as two lenses on the same substrate:
Unifying substrate (one small contract)
Model: a single source of truth you already lean toward: HSON/NEW tree + _attrs, _content, and QUIDs.
Ops bus: all change moves as patch ops:
set(path, value) / unset(path) / insert(path, idx, node) / move(path, from, to) …
Each op carries an origin token {origin:'store'|'dom:window'|'dom:livemap'} and a tx id for coalescing.
Subscriptions: components subscribe to ops with (op) => void and publish ops via the same bus. Loop-guard = ignore ops that match your own current tx/origin.
With that in place:
liveTree is the DOM projector
Direction: Model → DOM (mostly).
It owns rendering from HSON to actual elements, including your WindowComponent instances.
It listens to the ops bus; applies DOM diffs minimally (you already have comparers/IDs).
Limited DOM→Model only when you’ve explicitly opted in (e.g., attribute reflection from components when you want persistence).
liveMap is the Inspector/Editor projector
Snapshot: render a readable view for any model subtree.
Dashboard: subscribe to the ops bus; apply view-local DOM patches (text/value updates) without a full rerender.
Control panel: user edits → validate/coerce → publish ops back to the bus (origin = dom:livemap).
Both projectors:
Consume the same patch grammar.
Use the same identity scheme (QUID/path).
Never talk to each other directly; they meet at the bus.


The Real Design Choice: how to model array/object structure in HTML so it’s readable, inspectable, and editable without fighting the platform. You don’t need _VSN tags in the DOM to do that. Think in layers:
A. DOM shape (stable, HTML-legal)
Pick one of these (you can mix):
Details-tree (zero-JS toggles)
Each node is a <details> with a <summary> showing the key + a small type badge.
Children render inside the <details>.
Arrays: index badges; Objects: key labels; Primitives: inline value.
Pros: built-in toggle, good baseline a11y; minimal code.
Cons: limited keyboard control unless you add it; styling quirks.
ARIA tree (custom but precise)
Container with role="tree", items with role="treeitem", groups with role="group", aria-expanded on expandable nodes.
Pros: full keyboard, screen reader parity.
Cons: you own the interactions.
List/definition hybrids (semantic-ish)
Objects as <dl> pairs (<dt> key / <dd> value).
Arrays as <ol>/<ul>; nested content sits inside the <li>.
Pros: simple, printable, CSS-friendly.
Cons: expand/collapse is extra work; not a true “tree.”
Whatever you choose, use HTML-legal wrappers, e.g. h-obj, h-arr, h-ii if you like custom tags—or just native tags with attributes. Avoid _obj in the browser DOM.
B. Node metadata (carry your VSN without illegal tags)
Set data-vsn="_obj" | "_arr" | "_ii" | "_str" | "_val".
Also set a stable path: data-path="/ingredients/_arr[3]/name".
Optionally: data-key, data-index, data-type, data-size to avoid recomputing.
This gives you selectors like [data-vsn="_arr"] and robust hit-testing for edits.
C. Rendering invariants (so LiveMap stays sane)
1 DOM node per logical node. Children live in a dedicated container (e.g., [data-slot="children"]), so you can replace a subtree in one step.
Stable ordering: keep object keys in either source order (if you track it) or a deterministic order (alpha). Pick and never change per view.
Path format: dot for simple keys, bracket for arrays and weird keys (/foo.bar becomes ['foo.bar']). Keep an escaping rule; don’t wing it.
Large data:
Collapse by default beyond N children; show a count badge.
Lazy-render children on first expand.
Virtualize long arrays (render a window) if you might show 1k+ items.
D. Interaction model (baseline, then grow)
Expand/collapse: <details> gives you this for free; ARIA tree needs keyboard (Arrow, Home/End, Enter/Space) and aria-expanded.
Hover/selection: add a lightweight selection class; show the path in a status bar.
Inline editing (optional): primitives become editable spans; commit on blur/Enter; write back via your Result/ErrReport pipeline.
Context actions: copy value, copy path, add/remove key/element; keep these on a small icon to avoid clutter.
E. Styling (readability first)
Monospace for values; subtle color for types ("str", 123, true, null).
Tiny badges: [obj] {12}, [arr] {35}. Keep them non-interactive.
Truncation with safe expansion: clipped long strings show an ellipsis + “more.”
Use a thin baseline sheet: e.g., h-obj, h-arr { display:block }, paddings for nesting, focus rings for keyboard nav.
F. Performance + updates
Diff by path: when data changes, reconcile using data-path keys to target minimal DOM operations.
Avoid innerHTML: always set textContent for string values to escape safely.
IntersectionObserver for offscreen subtrees if you have deep trees plus heavy formatting.
G. Edge cases you’ll hit
Key order isn’t guaranteed in vanilla JSON; decide and stick to a policy (track order on ingest if you care).
Special values: NaN, Infinity, undefined aren’t JSON—decide how to display them if they can appear in your pipeline.
BigInt / Dates: display hints (e.g., 123n, 2025-10-26T12:00Z) but keep raw under data-raw.
Very long strings / binary: summarize with length and MIME-ish hint if known.
XSS: never inject untrusted strings as HTML. Always text.
H. Mapping from your _VSN model
Keep your internal nodes as _obj/_arr/_ii/_str/_val. At render time:
Rename for DOM (_obj → h-obj) or use a single native wrapper with data-vsn.
Round-trip fidelity lives in your data model, not the DOM. The DOM is a view.
I. Minimal viable plan for LiveMap
Choose Details-tree for v1.
Emit HTML-legal wrappers with data-vsn + data-path.
Baseline CSS for nesting, badges, and monospace values.
Lazy-render children on expand; cap array previews at, say, 50.
Provide copy-path / copy-value; selection and hover highlight.
Later, upgrade to ARIA tree if you want richer keyboard control.
This gives you a clean, sturdy inspector that presents objects structurally in HTML, avoids illegal tag names, and slots neatly into your existing HSON/live systems without a big rewrite.
