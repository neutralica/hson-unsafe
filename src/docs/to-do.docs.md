TO DO

hson.liveMap [before 2026?]
hson.component
___________

- liveTree.listen - event listener getter method
    "tree.listen.onMouseMove(updateXY());"
    -- basically expedites tree.asDocument().setEventListener(), + maybe adds a few creature comforts
    -- interesting opportunity to make event listeners unannoying (built-in mappping & removal for GC is easy first thought; maybe validation of some kind)
    -- chained methods optional--TBD (but why not; event listeners have a few fairly constrained types and options, seems like an ideal pattern)
- motes width independent of screen
