/**
 * Produce a canonical JSON string for an arbitrary value.
 *
 * This is intended for stable comparisons (tests, caches, diffs), not for
 * serialization fidelity or performance. Objects are recursively normalized
 * by sorting keys lexicographically at every level before stringification.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Primitives are returned as-is through JSON.stringify.
 * - Arrays preserve order, but their elements are canonicalized.
 * - Plain objects are deep-copied with keys sorted deterministically.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Property order is the only normalization performed; values are not coerced.
 * - Cyclic structures are not supported and will throw via JSON.stringify.
 *
 * @param x - Any JSON-serializable value.
 * @returns A deterministic JSON string representation.
