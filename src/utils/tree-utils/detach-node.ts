/**
 * Recursively detach an HSON node and its descendants from the live DOM.
 *
 * Walk order:
 * 1) Recurses through `_content` first, detaching child nodes before the parent.
 * 2) For each node, resolves its bound DOM element (if any) and:
 *    - removes all listeners registered via the listener system for that element,
 *    - removes all listeners for every DOM descendant of that element (defensive cleanup),
 *    - removes the element from the document.
 * 3) Deletes the node→element association from `NODE_ELEMENT_MAP`.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This is a teardown utility for LiveTree/HSON graphs; it assumes the node may be
 *   bound to a real DOM subtree via `NODE_ELEMENT_MAP`.
 * - Listener cleanup is best-effort and scoped to the internal listener registry
 *   (`_listeners_off_for_target`). It does not affect handlers attached outside that system.
 * - The descendant sweep prevents leaks when listeners were attached below the node’s root.
 * - Safe to call on nodes that were never mounted: no-op aside from map delete.
 *
 * @param node - Root HSON node to detach (deep).
